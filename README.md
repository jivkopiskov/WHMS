## Get Started
The app is hosted with Azure App Service and can be reached here:   https://whms.azurewebsites.net
The test admin credentials are admin@whms.com PW: password123
New registrations require to be approved by an administrator and confirmed emails, so keep that in mind, if you can't login after registering.

## Overview
WHMS inventory and orders management system, which I'm developing for the ASP.NET Core MVC course at [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/) (September-December 2020). The app is designed to be used by E-Commerce or retail businesses, to manage their available inventory, sales and purchase orders.
